# FORD BIKE DATA EXPLORATION
## by Cletus Lunalo


## Dataset

The dataset used in the notebooks is on individual trips made in a bike-sharing system that covers the greater San Francisco Bay area.The data was collected in February 2019.Prior to wrangling the dataset contained 174952 rows and 15 column.Variables in the dataset includes the start and end times for each trip,the duration, names,latitudes and longitudes of the start and end stations.It also includes details of each user such as the gender,birth year,type of user(customer or subscriber) and whether they shared a bike or not.


## Summary of Findings
The main objective of this exploration was to investigatethe characteristics of the trips made and how they vary by gender, age group,user type, or if it involves bike share or not.Another importance was to also analyse how the trips vary by day and time.This information can help the organization in planning to increase bike use in the greater San Fransisco area.

Almost half of the trips are  made by users aged between  31-40(44%) followed by the those  aged between 21-30.These two age groups account for 70% of the trips made.The mean age was 35 years.The Majority of the trips are made by male users (75%) while less than a quarter are  made by female users(23%).The majority of the trips are made by subscribers(90%) while less than 10% of them are made by Customers.Less than 10% of the trips involve sharing a bike.Majority of the customers who share bikes during a trip are aged between 21-30 whilst very few users from the other groups share bikes.

An average trip takes 510 secs or about 8 minutes.The average trip covers 1.4km although there is a very long right tail in the distribution of distance.The most frequent cycling time used by the majority of the users was between 12am to 5 am(33.8%) amd between 8 am to 11 am(28.9%).The third most frequent cycling time was between 5 am to 8 a.m.Thursday had the highest number of trips  followed by Tuesday.The number of trips was lowest on Sunday and Saturday.The highest time spent per trip was recorded on the weekends with sunday having the highest.The lowest time per trip was recorded on Tuesday.Whilst men covered the least distance per trip,they used the lowest time per trip.The 21-30 age group spend the least time per trip while the eldest age group spend the highest time per trip. Trips made by customers lasted for  longer durations than  trips made by subscribers.The popular times for starting a trip for the three gender categories i.e female,male and other, was between 12 am to 5 am and between 8am to 11 am.No woman took a trip as from 5pm to 8pm.The 'Other' gender did not undertake any trips past 2pm.

## Insights for the explanatory presentation

For the presentation slide,I  focus on summarising the socioeconomic profile of the trips.This  includes:frequency of trips made  per age group,gender,bike share,user type,day and time.The presentation will also explore difference in trip made by users who share bikes by age groups and the differences in number of trips made by  time of the day and day.
